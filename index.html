<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>
There are lots of ways to stay up to date on blogs and webcomics (Google Reader is a great example of such a program).
They all do a great job of keeping you up to date on your favorite web periodicals. However, none of them provide a very
good mechanism for <strong>starting</strong> a new webcomic. If you add xkcd.com to your Google Reader feed, you'll only
have access to all future xkcd comics, but none from the past.
</p>
<p>
My solution to this problem has simply been to pull a marathon catching up to the present and then staying up to date with
Google Reader. I don't think I've ever actually managed to do this because I'd keep losing track of where I was in the comic.
</p>

<h1>What?</h1>
<p>
Using your favorite browser's bookmarking system partially solves this problem, but you need to remember to update your bookmarks
after every single comic you read. What is really needed is a form of "dynamic bookmark" that updates every time you click
the "next comic" link.
</p>
<p>
DynamicBookmarker aims to do just this. It's a bookmarklet, so it should run on any (sufficiently compliant) webbrowser. However, I've only
tested it on Google Chrome and Firefox.

<h1>Pictures!</h1>

<p>
To install, simply drag <a href="javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.onload=function(){DynamicBookmarker.enter()};s.type='text/javascript';s.src='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1463845/unhosted/reader.js';document.body.appendChild(s)})();
">DynamicBookmarker</a> to your bookmark bar.

</p>

<p>
Then go to your favorite webcomic and click on the <strong>DynamicBookmarker</strong> bookmarklet.

<p>
Sign in. Note: There is no signing up, or password protection. For now, this service is entirely trust based.

</p>

<p>
Once you're logged in, you should see a list of webcomics you're in the middle of reading.

</p>

<p>
As you read the webcomic, note that only the "#" part of the url changes. The title of the website
should also be prefixed with "DynamicBookmarker" (the images are a little outdated, they say "Webreader" instead)

<p>
Restart browser, go back to favorite webcomic.

</p>

<p>
Click on DynamicBookmarker. Your username was stored in a cookie, so you should automatically be directed to the last comic you read. Enjoy!
